## Project Overview

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for performing EDA on various ICT subdimensions such as access, usage, skills, and infrastructure. The objective is to identify significant patterns and generate actionable insights from the given data.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Briefly mention the source, e.g., public datasets, surveys, etc.]
- **Description:** The dataset includes multiple features related to ICT, such as internet penetration, device availability, digital literacy, and more.
- **Format:** CSV/Excel/Other (specify as appropriate)

## Analysis Approach

The EDA process involves:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics and summary analysis
- Visualization of key metrics and distributions
- Correlation analysis between ICT subdimensions
- Identification of trends and anomalies

## Key Findings

- Summarize a few key insights or findings from your analysis (update with your actual results).
  - Example: "Identified a strong correlation between digital literacy and internet access."
  - Example: "Observed regional disparities in ICT infrastructure availability."

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Praveshika2k/EDA---ICT-Subdimensions.git
    cd EDA---ICT-Subdimensions
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    - Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
    - Install required packages with:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3. **Run the analysis:**
    - Open and execute the provided Jupyter notebooks, or run the analysis scripts:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook
      ```
    - Alternatively, use:
      ```bash
      python analysis_script.py
      ```

## Results & Visualizations

All results, charts, and visualizations generated from the analysis are available in the `results` or `outputs` directory. Notable visualizations include:
- Distribution plots of ICT indicators
- Correlation heatmaps
- Regional comparisons
